ASU Webauth Changelog

6.x-2.0-beta5, 2011-06-08
-------------------------
- Improved support for the ASU header.
- New webauth bypass settings allows a custom list of paths and a custom list
  of user agents (i.e web spiders) to skip webauth authentication.

6.x-2.0-beta4, 2010-08-30
-------------------------
New features
- Optional LDAP user common name lookup based on ASURITE ID. If enabled, this
  value will be used when rendering user names using theme_username(). These
  names are cached locally for performance reasons.
- A form specifically made for quickly adding ASURITE users is now available
  at /admin/user/user/add-asuwebauth.
Bug fixes
- Better tracking of user login / logout state results in better behavior
  regarding auto-login / logout of users whose Webauth state has changed.
- Play nicely with Drush, Services, Features Server, cron, and search engines.
- Support for sites that run within a sub-path of a domain, e.g.
  example.asu.edu/drupal
- Fix "access denied" issues when users who aren't members of a site attempt
  to logout of Webauth.
- Fix endless redirect loop when users aren't auto-registered but attempt to
  login to a page that requires registration.
- Redirect users to the path alias for a page, if one exists.
- Improved code documentation and cleanup per Coder module review.


6.x-2.0-beta3, 2010-07-08
-------------------------
- Add settings to override the login and logout destination URLs
- Use the webconsulting.asu.edu Features server to host the module so
  that Update Status will now accurately reflect whether or not a new
  release of the module is available.
- Address numerous bugs related to login / logout, particularly when
  using the ASU Header 3.0
- Fix a pass-by-reference typo (caused PHP notices)
- Fix form submissions being lost if a user's Webauth state had changed
  between page load and page submission.


6.x-2.0-beta1, 2010-01-29
-------------------------
IMPORTANT:
This version of the module complies with Webauth protocol v2.2. This
protocol version requires /all/ sites running Webauth to be registered
to the Webauth client whitelist.

@TODO (Add process for requesting a domain be added to the webauth client
whitelist).

- Completely rewritten from the ground up.
- Complies with Webauth protocol v2.2
- Rewrite has address numerous bugs, in particular:
  - Endless redirect loops
  - 6.x version required account registration, even though it presented
    it as an option. New version /does not/ require account creation.


6.x-1.0, 2008-11-04
-------------------------
Porting to 6.x
- Manually included the user.pages.inc file to compensate for Drupal 6 
  streamlining the module loading and not loading this required inc file.

  webauth.  Local login can still be accessed via /user?locallogin
- User roles are now updated on every login, to ensure webauth role gets set.
- Added optional setting to allow the user email field to be blank.
- Fixed issues where errors were reported upon user creation.
- Attempted to fix issue where module would think the user had an active 
  webauth session when they actually don't.  This needs to be tested and 
  verified.

  of being in one large array.
- General code cleanup
