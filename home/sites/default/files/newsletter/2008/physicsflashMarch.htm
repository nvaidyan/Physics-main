		<p style="text-autospace: none; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
		<font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp; ASU Physics is proud to 
		support the Physics and Astronomy Graduate Women&#8217;s Association (PAGWA). 
		The group&#8217;s origin began informally a couple of years ago when
		<img border="0" src="PAGWA.JPG" width="353" height="214" align="left" hspace="2" vspace="2">female 
		graduate students began sharing common concerns with Marcia Levitus, 
		Professor of Chemistry and affiliate faculty in ASU Physics and the 
		Center for Biological Physics.</font></p>
		<p style="text-autospace: none; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
		<font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp; Informal discussions 
		eventually led to the creation of PAGWA which today has about 30 members 
		who meet every other week<span style="font-size: 3pt"> </span></font>
		</p>
		<p style="text-autospace: none; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
		<font face="Times New Roman" style="font-size: 3pt">&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman">
		<span style="font-size: 3pt">&nbsp;</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The group provides a safe and open forum to discuss experiences and 
		struggles female graduate students encounter regularly. Members have 
		found the opportunity to discuss communication techniques, interview 
		strategies, and work/life balance issues helpful and timely. Frequent 
		guest speakers &#8212; both male and female &#8212; address a variety topics and 
		meetings are open to all regardless of gender. </font></p>
		<p style="text-autospace: none; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
		<font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly to Levitus, the 
		group&#8217;s discussions have &#8220;actually triggered many interesting 
		conversations with some of the male professors in the department, 
		including the Chair of Physics &#8212; Robert Nemanich &#8212; who is extremely 
		supportive (of PAGWA)&#8221;. </font></p>
		<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		When asked about the statistics on women in science, Levitus and PAGWA 
		student member Ashley Kibel agree that progress is underway &#8212; 
		particularly in biology and chemistry. Physics is moving much slower and 
		Levitus and Kibel both cite the perception that women are not good at 
		math as perhaps one reason why women do not pursue degrees in physics.&nbsp;<br>

		<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		&#8220;My very first reality check was when I moved to the US as a postdoc. I 
		never experienced anything serious, but there are tons of small things 
		that I would clearly identify as gender-related.&nbsp; For example, when I 
		was a postdoc in Berkeley I invited a couple of lab mates for dinner at 
		home.&nbsp; One of my male lab mates was checking some books on a desk and 
		said something like 'I see that your husband likes computer 
		programming'.&nbsp; The guy clearly assumed that those books could not 
		possibly be mine, even (though) he knew that my work was computationally 
		intensive. </font></p>
		<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		&quot;It turns out that my husband has a long list of wonderful qualities, 
		but computer programming is clearly not one of his skills. We still 
		laugh about the anecdote. This is (on the surface) not serious, but it
		<img border="0" src="marcia.JPG" width="136" height="206" align="left">is 
		that same type of reasoning was often used to assume that the females in 
		the lab could not do serious data analysis and some guy was consulted 
		instead. This and other stereotypes are so deeply embedded in all of us 
		that they end up hurting female scientists in the more math and 
		computationally demanding fields even when no conscious discrimination 
		is intended.&#8221;</font></p>
		<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; 
		Kibel believes the low percentage of women in physics may have a domino 
		effect.<br>
&nbsp; &#8220;A lot of women identify with the feeling of isolation that can exist as 
		a woman in a field dominated by men&nbsp; It is not out of the ordinary to be 
		one of the only - potentially THE only - female in a graduate-level 
		physics class.&nbsp; I think that, sometimes, this is very intimidating.&nbsp;
		</font></p>
		<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Furthermore, 
		since there are so few women in faculty positions, it is hard to find a 
		role model who is a good example of a woman who has achieved a 
		successful career in physics&#8221; says Kibel. &#8220;It&#8217;s harder to convince 
		yourself that you can have a successful career when you rarely see women 
		in positions ahead of you.&#8221; <br>
&nbsp; However, Levitus and Kibel and many other members of PAGWA advise girls 
		and women to continue pursuing science as a career.</font></p>
		<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">
		&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;If you have an interest in science,&#8221; Kibel states &#8220;don&#8217;t let

		<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Times New Roman">
		&nbsp; Levitus echoes &#8220;Look for supporting people around you&#8230;A career in 
		science can be a lot of fun and extremely rewarding, so do what you want 
		to do with passion and do not think that your gender will be an issue,

&nbsp;In what has become an annual event, the American Association for the 
			Advancement of Science organize visits to the offices of many 
			congressional leaders.&nbsp; I was part of the delegation of the 
			Materials Research Society and was able to visit the Washington 
			offices of Senator Jon Kyl and Congressman Ed Pastor this March.&nbsp; 
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Senator Kyl plays a key role on the Senate Finance Committee, and 
			Congressman Pastor is on the House Appropriations Committee and 
			three related important subcommittees.&nbsp;<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			I visited both offices last year, and it was a pleasure to continue 
			our discussions about the partnership of science and technology 
			research and education and the funding support supplied by the US 
			government.&nbsp; 
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			In Senator Kyl&#8217;s office our group met with Legislative Counsel Abby 
			Donovan and Correspondent George Fleeson and the discussion focused 
			on the tremendous growth of science and technology-related companies 
			in Arizona and how their current and future successes relate to 
			advances in science research.&nbsp; Much of this research has been funded 
			through agencies such as the National Science Foundation, the 
			Department of Energy, the National Institute of Standards and 
			Technology, the National Aeronautics and Space Association, and the 
			Department of Defense.&nbsp; 
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Counsel Donovan was well aware of the importance of science research 
			and education and was planning a visit to ASU on her next trip to 
			Arizona. The MRS delegation recognized Senator Kyl&#8217;s support of the 
			America Competes Act which was signed into law in 2007. 
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			In Congressman Pastor&#8217;s office, we met with Senior Legislative 
			Assistant Richard Patrick.&nbsp; I had met with Richard last year, and I 
			again enjoyed the opportunity to advance our discussion.&nbsp; With the 
			growth of ASU&#8217;s downtown campus which is in the Congressman&#8217;s 
			district, this was an even more focused discussion. Our conversation 
			explored the impact of both science education and research 
			particularly centered on the new health and technology focus of the 
			district.&nbsp; 
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			We appreciated the Congressman&#8217;s support of the America Competes 
			Act, and we all acknowledged the complexities in advancing the 
			programs through the parallel appropriations bills.&nbsp; 
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			The other component of the partnership was particularly evident at 
			two recent meetings - the March Meeting of the American Physics 
			Society and the Spring Meeting of the Materials Research Society.&nbsp; 
			At the APS meeting, there was tremendous excitement toward the

		Department of Physics in conjunction with the Department of Chemistry 
		and Biochemistry announces the establishment of the Professional Science 
		Masters (PSM) in Nanoscience degree program. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Arizona Board of Regents approved the PSM in Nanoscience degree 
		program in January 2008. <br>
		<span style="color:black">&nbsp;&nbsp; Arizona State University</span><span style="color:
black"> is one of several institutions offering Professional Science Masters 
		(PSM) degrees, but the only university to have a program specifically in 
		nanoscience.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="color:black">The two-year PSM degree which 
		launches in Fall 2008 is an innovative approach to meeting the growing 
		needs of industry by training students and working professionals in 
		areas vital to career growth: math, science, business, engineering and 
		technology. PSM graduate students will take classes as well as complete 
		internship projects at private businesses or government agencies.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; John Venables, ASU Physics Professor and a driving force behind the 
		development of the new program, stresses that nanoscience is already 
		tremendous strength at ASU. &quot;Recent reorganizations at ASU are going a 
		long way towards creating an environment that is very supportive of 
		[interdisciplinary] programs and &#8216;departments without walls,&#8217;&#8221; he said. 
		Venables point to the number of industry partners in Arizona, adding 
		that the PSM will bring global attention to the research efforts in the 
		Valley of the Sun.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ASU has more than 40 tenured and tenure track faculty researching 
		and teaching in this dynamic area, and in several national and 
		internationally recognized research institutes and facilities.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Three of the planned areas of concentration for students in the PSM 
		program will be Nano-Materials and Nanoelectronics, Biophysics and 
		Bionanotechnology, and Biophysics, Biochemistry and Sensors. The 
		interdisciplinary program will be based in the Department of Physics 
		with courses also offered through ASU&#8217;s Department of Chemistry and 
		Biochemistry, the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering, and the ASU 
		School of Life Sciences.</span></p>
