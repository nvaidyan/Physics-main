		<p><span style="font-size:3.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On Friday, April 
		25, ASU Physics hosted the Fourth Annual Undergraduate Research 
		Symposium.&nbsp; Eight physics undergraduate students shared presentations 
		highlighting their ongoing research with faculty, REU summer experiences, and 
		other research topics in their respective areas of interest within 
		physics.<br>
		&nbsp; Participants gave 15 minute presentations to an audience of 
		faculty, graduate students, and other physics undergraduates. The event 
		was organized by Professor Michael Treacy, Director of Undergraduate 
		Programs, and Sabrina Mathues, Academic Advisor and Undergraduate 
		Program Coordinator. <br>
&nbsp; &#8220;This is an opportunity for undergraduates to get a taste of what the 
		future holds for them,&#8221; says Mathues &#8220;Many will go on to graduate school 
		and postdoc positions where presentations are common and a critical part 
		of a job search.&#8220;<br>
&nbsp; Although the event was successful in terms of the quality of 
		presentations, it&nbsp; also underscored the 
		enthusiasm undergraduates hold for research and discovery.&nbsp; ASU 
		Physics congratulations to all symposium 
		participants on their&nbsp; presentations and looks forward to their 
		future success in research.</td>

		&nbsp; My own college (Ormond College) was an imposing Victorian castle 
		complete with battlements, towers, lawns and sculpture. Formal dinners 
		were held each day in a great hall and attendees come in full academic 
		gown.<br>
		&nbsp; Oil paintings of past College Masters going back a hundred years 
		surrounded us at dinner. But it was Bryn Newton-John whose portrait held 
		our gaze. Centered above High Table for all to see, physics students 
		knew that he was married to the eldest daughter of the great physicist 
		and Nobel laureate Max Born and that he had worked with Allan Turing on 
		the Enigma project at Bletchley Park &#8212; the site of code-breaking efforts 
		in the United Kingdom during World War II. Turing helped design arguably 
		the first electronic computer used to crack the Nazi U-boat codes. <br>
		&nbsp; We at Ormond College were delighted when the Newton-John&#8217;s daughter, 
		Olivia, became a popular singer in the 1960s and 70s, leading to her 
		movie role with John Travolta in immensely popular movie &#8220;Grease&#8221;. <br>
		&nbsp; The memory I have of her grandfather Born&#8217;s disapproval of her singing 
		style in her early career and the memories of my studies at Ormond came 
		flooding back to me when, on a trip to London, I picked up <i>It Must Be 
		Beautiful: Great Equations of Modern Science</i>, a wonderful book 
		edited by Graham Farmelo. <br>
&nbsp; This is a superb read for any physical scientist.&nbsp; The book consists of 
		eleven chapters, each authored by a contemporary scientist or science 
		writer and focused on one of the great equations of science and how it 
		came about.&nbsp; These essays rarely contain more than one equation. Yet, 
		every chapter is full of fascinating anecdotes, history and insight into 
		how these great equations arose. The book concludes with an afterword by 
		Steven Weinberg.

		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">The editor 
		begins with Einstein, Planck, and the quantized energy of the photon. 
		The chapter follows the path from Clausius through the ultraviolet 
		catastrophe to Planck&#8217;s uncomfortable quantization. <br>
&nbsp; Max Planck, like 
		Hemmingway, worked standing up at a lectern, and first wrote down&nbsp; 
		his distribution on Sunday evening October 7, 1900. He presented his 
		quantum modification of Ludwig Boltzman&#8217;s statistics at a talk in Berlin 
		in December after &#8220;the most exhausting few weeks of work in my life&#8221;. 
		For Planck, the importance of his work lay not in quantization at all, 
		but in the prospect it held for a new system of natural units.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone else saw the quantization as a mere mathematical formality 
		without physical significance. Only Einstein saw the flaw in Planck&#8217;s 
		theory (normalization) and took an additional leap. Einstein wrote that 
		&#8220;it is as if radiation consisted of quanta&#8221; in his photoelectric effect 
		paper. As we heard in a recent excellent ASU Physics&#8217; colloquium, this 
		was arguably the greatest of his 1905 papers. The next year, Einstein 
		quantized photons and explained the specific heat anomaly in one of only 
		three papers he would ever publish which compare theory and experiment.
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; Interestingly, the chapter also illustrates Planck and Einstein&#8217;s 
		common musical interests. Planck

		who expressed an interest, including the Queen of Belgium. <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; In another chapter, Robert May writes about the fascinating 
		and deceptively simple Logistic Map equation which describes the chaotic 
		behavior of everything in ecology - from spawning salmon to grouse 
		populations. He traces this back to Henri Poincare&#8217;s work on the 
		stability of the planetary orbits.</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><br>
&nbsp; May</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman"> 
		reviews modern chaos theory in meteorology (think &#8220;butterfly 
		effect&#8221;). He 
		also discusses the discovery that even phenomena described by 
		differential equations can be chaotic (&#8220;deterministic chaos&#8221;), so that 
		sensitivity to initial conditions&nbsp; can lead to an unpredictability; an 
		unpredictability which some may call &#8220;free will&#8221;. He also makes 
		connection with unpredictable (individual) quantum jumps. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; May strongly recommends James Gleick&#8217;s popular book <i>Chaos</i> (1988). 
		It was Gleick&#8217;s book that caused Al Gore to hire a mathematician 
		specifically to teach him the essentials of the theory.<i><br>
		</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further in the book, we find a chapter on the Drake equation. The 
		Drake equation was new to me. It was written down in 1961 at the first &#8220;SETI&#8221; 
		workshop in Green Bank, West Virginia. Frank Drake had estimated the 
		number N of radio-emitting civilizations in the galaxy. The 
		contributions of Carl Sagan, Philip Morrison and Melvin Calvin (who 
		received notification of his Nobel award at the workshop) are reviewed.<i><br>

			</font>Our physics textbooks develop the known fundamental concepts 
			of the relation of matter and energy and of space and time and 
			provide mathematics that describe physical phenomena.&nbsp; Indeed 
			students of physics at all levels are able to apply these concepts 
			to solve amazingly complex problems and provide precise and 
			quantitative answers.<br>
&nbsp; At ASU, many of our students of physics (both undergraduate and graduate) 
			are actively involved in advancing the forefront of knowledge 
			through their research projects. In these projects, students are 
			challenged to understand new phenomena that are not described in 
			their textbooks.&nbsp; They must organize the concepts, develop 
			quantitative measurements and/or mathematical descriptions, and use 
			the scientific method to bring forth new knowledge that may well 
			impact our society.<br>
&nbsp; The excitement of discovery and innovation, and the advancement of 
			science knowledge were certainly evident at the Fourth Annual 
			Undergraduate Research Symposium.&nbsp; It was a pleasure to listen as 
			our students describe concepts that ranged from quantum interference 
			and information transfer, to nanoscale properties of materials for 
			electronics, to understanding the interactions of the fundamental 
			particles of matter.<br>
&nbsp; ASU Physics has an exceedingly dynamic research program that is driven by 
			the enthusiasm, intellect and creativity of our undergraduate and 
			graduate students. Our students are urged to push forward, to 
			discover, to innovate, and to advance our knowledge. In walking 
			through the Research Symposium and the halls of the Physical 
			Sciences Building, it is evident that our students have accepted 
			every challenge.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

		an annual volunteer community service event organized by the ASU Public 
		Events Office.<br>
&nbsp; This year&#8217;s event was organized as a on-day project to help revitalize 
		Thunderbird Park by trimming overgrown vegetation, removing trash from 
		the adjacent creek, and cleaning park common areas.</p>

		ASU Physics participated with a five member team organized by ASU 
		Physics Academic Advisor Sabrina Mathues. The team included ASU Physics

		human-dolphin communication analogous to the larger-scale interstellar 
		communication effort.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1971 follow-up workshop included 
		such luminaries as Francis Crick, Thomas Gold, Marvin Minsky, Carl 
		Sagan, Boris Shklovskii and later Freeman Dyson, Ronald Bracewell and 
		Frank Tipler. <br>
&nbsp; To some extent all this work derives from the question Fermi posed to 
		Teller at lunch one day at Los Alamos in 1950 when he asked &#8220;Where is 
		everybody?&#8221;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; to which everyone laughed, 
		guessing his meaning. This is one chapter in the book which could do 
		with some serious updating in view of the very recent planetary 
		discoveries which must greatly reduce N.<br>
&nbsp; Peter Galison uses John Wheeler&#8217;s famous 1945 Survey of Science to launch 
		an essay on the history of E=mc<sup>2</sup>, with lively quotes from 
		letters between Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner following Meitner&#8217;s dramatic 
		escape from Nazi Germany to Sweden on July 13, 1938. In the letters, 
		Hahn discussed his work with uranium which prompted Meitner and Otto 
		Frisch to take a step further. The rest is familiar history leading to 
		the Manhattan Project. Wheeler was travelling by ship with Niels Bohr to 
		the USA at the time. Having heard of the Hahn-Meitner letter, Wheeler 
		and Bohr worked out a comprehensive theory of fission. <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; Arthur Miller provides a spirited account of Erwin Schr&#246;dinger and 
		his wave equation. Miller states that Schr&#246;dinger &#8220;did his great work 
		during a late erotic outburst in his married life&#8221; at a ski resort with 
		his girlfriend in 1925. <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; Schr&#246;dinger was notorious for his womanizing and, at one point in his 
		life, actually had two wives &#8212; one of which was married to another man. 
		&#8220;It would be easier to live with a canary than a racehorse&#8221; said 
		Schr&#246;dinger&#8217;s wife, &#8220;but I prefer the racehorse&#8221;. The Byronic 
		Schr&#246;dinger was an impeccably dressed Weimar dandy and scholar of Hindu. 
		Interestingly Schr&#246;dinger was, like Werner Heisenberg and a handful of 
		scientists of the day, a pianist of near-concert standard. <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereas Schr&#246;dinger&#8217;s method triumphed, it was Heisenberg&#8217;s 
		interpretation that we use today. Einstein thought that Schr&#246;dinger was 
		correct and Heisenberg &#8220;off the track&#8221;. Heisenberg thought Schr&#246;dinger&#8217;s 
		theory &#8220;disgusting&#8221;. Max Born proposed a probabilistic interpretation of 
		Schr&#246;dinger&#8217;s wave function, causing Heisenberg &#8220;acute psychological 
		distress&#8221;. <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; Schr&#246;dinger never accepted Born&#8217;s interpretation or quantum jumps - 
		to Schr&#246;dinger his wave function was the real de-Broglie matter-wave. 
		But significantly Schr&#246;dinger gave up on trying to interpret 
		many-particle wave functions. As Richard Feynman later famously stated, 
		&#8220;I think I can safely say that no one understands quantum mechanics.&#8221;<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; This will give you some sense of the book. The other chapters are 
		equally good &#8212; Wilczek&#8217;s chapter on the Dirac equation, Roger Penrose on 
		General Relativity, John Maynard Smith on rate equations to model 
		evolution, Aisling Irwin on the Nobel-prize winning rate equations 
		describing ozone reactions with chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere,&nbsp; 
		Igor Aleksander on Claude Shannon&#8217;s equation, and Christine Sutton on 
		the Yang-Mills equation. <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; My only quibble with the book is that so many great equations are not 
		included, among them Navier-Stokes, Poisson, Newton&#8217;s Gravity, Fourier 
		on heat, and or course Maxwell who needs an entire book to himself; a 
		fact that was realized in the remarkable <i>The Maxwellians</i> by 
		B.J.Hunt, which I reviewed in an earlier issue of the Physics Flash (see
		<b>
		<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://physics.asu.edu/newsletter/physicsflashJuly.htm">
		HERE</a></b>).<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; All these omissions certainly don&#8217;t diminish the book, but only beg 
		the question &#8220;Where is Volume II?&#8221;</span></p>
