		Dr. Fernando Ponce, Professor of Physics at ASU. Dr. Ponce received the 
		Tricentennial Medal of UNSAAC. This year, the medal commemorated 
		UNSAAC's 300 years as a university. The medal recognizes &quot;exceptional 
		contributions to knowledge and to society&quot;.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The citation lauded 
		Professor Ponce, already an honorary professor at the university,
		for &quot;high recognition in his field of research and for his cultural and scientific 
		productivity&quot;. The citation also noted his &quot;exemplary dedication to the development of

		<i><b>PONCE:</b></i> I grew up a short distance (2 kilometers) from this

&nbsp; Many children in Latin America grow up dreaming of becoming scientists 
		and engineers, and the desire (exists) within an atmosphere of 
		tranquility and simplicity that allows their intellect to develop in a 
		peaceful setting.&nbsp; But most of those countries do not have the

		Winter, in my days in the 
		Midwest, was a time to reflect and plan (or shovel snow). Following this 
		tradition, the ASU Physics faculty came together on a Saturday in January to 
		discuss collaborations 
		and partnerships that enable us to address some of the most significant 
		questions in our field.&nbsp; </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; ">
		&nbsp; Other organizations might call this type of a 
		meeting a 'retreat,' but in the words of Professor Mike Treacy, &quot;ASU 
		Physics does not retreat, we advance.&quot; Thus our meeting was the second 
		annual <b><i>Physics Advance</i></b>.<br>
&nbsp; The Advance focused on building collaborations with 
		national facilities, international research centers - particularly in 
		the Americas, and extending our initiative on Emergent Phenomena.<br>
&nbsp; During the meeting, Professor Jeff Drucker described some of his 
		interactions with the Department of Energy Nanocenters. Other 
		faculty joined the discussion to express the opportunities at the Nanocenters. 
		Examples included Argonne National Laboratory where the x-ray synchrotron 
		presents unique capabilities for materials characterization and Oak 
		Ridge National Laboratory which has a highly advanced electron 
		microscopy facility.<br>
&nbsp; A very novel collaboration is developing between scientists interested in 
		research laboratories placed deep in the Earth.&nbsp; Professor Ricardo 
		Alarcon described some of the research topics to be explored in the Deep 
		Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory (DUSEL) which is now 
		planned to be developed in South Dakota.&nbsp; It would appear that 
		experimental programs on neutrino physics would be of particular 
		interest to ASU faculty.&nbsp; &nbsp;Other programs on microbial life, fluid flow 
		and rock deformation are also proposed for this truly uniquely 
		interdisciplinary facility.<br>
&nbsp; Professors Dave Smith and Fernando Ponce organized a detailed review of 
		the capabilities of numerous laboratories in Mexico and South America.&nbsp; 
		Fernando focused the discussion which ranged from building connections 
		for student exchanges to identifying potential collaborators for new 
		types of research teams.<br>
&nbsp; In our Advance last year, Professor Tim Newman captured everyone's 
		interest as he described how complex interactions that occur between 
		many particles and physical entities can lead to a whole new class of 
		phenomena.&nbsp; This year, he expanded on this vision by describing how this 
		class of Emergent Phenomena would involve collaborations across the 
		University.<br>
&nbsp; It was truly amazing to see the range of opportunities presented during 
		this day.<br>

			<b><font style="font-size: 20pt">BOOK REVIEW (continued)</font><font style="font-size: 16pt"><br>
			</font></b>around, and Trinity College Cambridge was the center of a 
			rather gay group called the <i>Apostles</i> which included 
			luminaries such as the mathematicians G. E. Moore and J. E. Littlewood, the philosophers Ludwig Wittgenstein and Bertrand 
			Russell, the economist John Maynard Keynes and the poet Rupert 
			Brooke. <br>
&nbsp; They talked mainly not about issues of war and peace so much but about 
			things like <i>Goldbach's Conjecture</i> that all even numbers 
			greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. Try a few 
			examples for yourself, for example 40 = 11 + 29. This was a worthy 
			problem for discussion they felt (it is still unresolved; to become 
			really famous - solve this problem rather than protein folding!).
			<br>
&nbsp; One morning in 1913, Hardy received a rambling letter from a poor Indian 
			villager, Srinivasa Ramanujan, on poor quality paper and poorly 
			written, but his eye was taken by an usual infinite series for<i> &#960;</i> 
			of a kind he had not seen before - which rapidly converged. He 
			summed the first few terms and it appeared to be correct and so 
			began one of the most interesting sagas of collaborative research in 
			the twentieth century. After an exchange of letters, each of which 
			took ~ month by boat to get to India, Ramanujan arrived at Trinity 
			College in Cambridge. He finds the life awful - he hates having to 
			wear shoes, the food and weather 
			<img border="0" src="indian%20clerk.JPG" width="197" height="300" align="right" hspace="4">awful (hard to argue with any of 
			that) but Ramanujan on his own and in partnership with Hardy 
			produces some of&nbsp;the greatest pure mathematics of the twentieth 
			century. <br>
&nbsp; Ramanujan became interested in <i>highly composite numbers</i> which he 
			defined as &quot;a number that is as far from a prime as a number can 
			be.&quot; A sort of anti-prime. Hardy and Littlewood asked for an 
			example. 'None of the numbers up to 24 has more than 6 divisors, 22 
			has 4, 21 has 4, 20 has 6. But 24 has 8. 24 can be divided by 1, 2, 
			3, 4, 6, 8, 12 or 24. So I define a <i>highly composite numbe</i>r 
			as a number that has more divisors than any number that comes before 
			it. What a strange raging mind! &nbsp;I have listed every highly 
			composite number up to 6,746,328,388,800&quot; And have you drawn any 
			conclusions? &quot;Well yes, you can work out a formula...&quot;<br>
&nbsp; What we glimpse here is an unusual mind a work - one that lay in the 
			hinterland between an arithmetic calculator and a trained 
			mathematician. He could manipulate large numbers mentally but what 
			pushed him into mathematics was his ability to produce algebraic 
			formulae. He was not a<i> typical</i> mathematician in that the 
			concept of a <i>proof </i>was alien to him and remained so despite 
			Hardy's best efforts. Today we would call this interdisciplinary 
			research perhaps.<br>
&nbsp; &quot;Proofs in mathematics have their own elegance and economy, as 
			illustrated by Euclid's proof that there are an infinite number of 
			prime numbers. This is a <i>reductio ad absurdum </i>proof, and so 
			we begin by assuming the opposite of what we want to prove: we 
			assume that there are only a finite number of primes, and we call 
			the <i>last </i>prime, the<i> largest</i> prime, <i>P.</i> We must 
			remember that, by definition, any non-prime number can be broken 
			down into primes. To choose a random example 190 breaks down as 19 x 
			5 x2. Assuming than that <i>P</i>, is the largest prime number, we 
			can write out the primes as a sequence, from smallest to largest, 
			and the sequence will look like this:<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">2, 
			3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23...<i>P</i></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><i>
			<span style="font-size: 3pt">&nbsp;</span><br>
&nbsp; </i>Then we can propose a number, <i>Q</i>, that is 1 greater than all 
			the primes multiplied together. That is to say </p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="center">
			<i>Q </i>= (2 x 3 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 13 ... x P) + 1<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
			<span style="font-size: 3pt">&nbsp;</span><br>
&nbsp; Either <i>Q</i> is a prime or it is not. If <i>Q </i>is a prime, this 
			contradicts the assumptions that<i> P</i> is the largest possible 
			prime. But if <i>Q </i>is not prime, it must be divisible by some prime, and that cannot be any of the primes leading up to and 
			including <i>P</i>. So the prime divisor of <i>Q</i> must be a prime 
			bigger than <i>P</i>, which again contradicts our original 
			assumption. Therefore there is no greatest prime. There is infinity 
			of primes.&quot; We can all enjoy the sparse elegance and beauty of such 
			a proof, but how many of us could come up with such an argument?<br>
&nbsp; Parenthetically, I note that a similar style of proof can be given to 
			show that all numbers are interesting. Suppose the lowest 
			uninteresting number was <i>U,</i> then of course that in itself 
			would make it interesting. Therefore as there can be no lowest 
			uninteresting number, all numbers are interesting. Does this bother 
			you - it should - if it prevents you from sleeping - email me!<br>
&nbsp; This book is well enough written, but lacks the sharp focus that its 
			subjects demonstrated in their mathematics. But the story is a good 
			one and it holds one's attention - good beach reading. I would have 
			preferred more mathematics for my own taste, but of course it is 
			aimed at a wider audience. <br>
&nbsp; What can we learn from this? &nbsp;For one 
			thing that innovation does not need to come through formal training. 
			Knowing what everyone else knows is usually good, but can also be 
			confining sometimes. I once wasted an afternoon with a builder from 
			Michigan who could show that <i>&#960; </i>= 3 - but he was no Ramanujan! 
			But I still glance through those crazy emails - just in case. 
			<br>
&nbsp; Finally the old must give way to the young which is where the truly 
			new ideas come from - Hardy provides a great example of an unselfish 
			mentor.<br>
