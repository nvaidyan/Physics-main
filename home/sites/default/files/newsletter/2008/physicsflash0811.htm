						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left">The past 
						century witnessed enormous progress in unraveling the 
						origin, structure and evolution of the visible matter in 
						the universe—the material that makes up stars, planets, 
						and life forms. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our evolving understanding of the structure of matter in XX century 
						was an interplay of theoretical and experimental 
						advances that yielded several paradigm changes that<img border=0 width=409 height=398
src="2008-11_files/image001.gif" align=right>
						revolutionized physics and technologies that emerged 
						from it. The discovery of radioactive decays and 
						Rutherford scattering experiments, which demonstrated 
						the existence of atomic nucleus, were matched by 
						powerful theoretical foundation: the Einstein’s theory 
						of special relativity, stating that mass and energy were 
						truly interchangeable, and the introduction of quantum 
						mechanics. The realization that nuclear reactions 
						provide the energy that drives the cosmos revolutionized 
						our understanding of the universe. Finally the 
						scattering of high-energy electron beam on nucleons led 
						to the discovery of point-like, i.e., partonic, 
						structure inside the proton and neutron and confirmed 
						that these particles are made of more fundamental 
						building blocks—quarks and gluons,<span style="color:black"> 
						which make up 99 percent of the mass of our everyday 
						world. </span>&nbsp;The theory which encodes the strong 
						interaction physics was realized to be a gauge field 
						theory called quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Quarks are 
						bound to each other by the strongest force in the 
						universe so tightly that one quark cannot exist by 
						itself. The c<img border=0 width=278 height=642
src="2008-11_files/image002.gif" align=left>arries 
						of the force are gluons which are much like photons but 
						come in eight different species and also can directly 
						interact with each other. The latter property creates 
						the main obstacle in solving QCD using the same tools as 
						for its electromagnetic cousin as that contrary to the 
						latter the former becomes strong when one attempts to 
						separate hadronic constituents apart (see Fig. 2) thus 
						making traditional perturbative methods invalid. The 
						main focus of our studies in QCD is understanding the 
						quark confinement and its implications for the structure 
						of hadrons. We use diverse techniques for this purpose, 
						both phenomenological and analytical.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the most fascinating possibilities of modern 
						electron-scattering experiments is that they can measure 
						the spatial distribution of quarks and gluons, providing 
						actual three-dimensional images of the proton at the 
						femtometer scale. The reconstruction of spatial images 
						from scattering experiments by way of Fourier transform 
						of the observed scattering pattern is a technique widely 
						used in physics, e.g., in X-ray scattering from 
						crystals. Recently, it was discovered how to extend this 
						technique to the spatial distribution of quarks and 
						gluons within the proton, using processes that probe the 
						proton at a tiny resolution scale.
						<span style="color:black">Our major contribution in this 
						line of endeavor was in the development of a novel 
						approach to understanding quark confinement through the 
						study of microscopic partonic characteristics of 
						strongly interacting particle based on the concept of 
						generalized parton distributions. This is </span>a rich 
						formalism that both unifies existing descriptions of 
						proton structure and takes a giant leap into unknown 
						territory. <span style="color:black">In brief, a 
						generalized parton distribution is a relativistic 
						equivalent of the quantum mechanical Wigner 
						quasiprobability distribution and provides complete 
						information about a quantum mechanical state, contrary 
						to conventional probes. It encodes the quantum phase of 
						their wave function not just their absolute value.</span><span style="color: black"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

				<span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">I enjoyed 
				reading this expanded and updated version of the original book 
				that I had read some years ago. No prior knowledge is required 
				to enjoy the 200 pages over a weekend. I often think about 
				imperfect packing when I throw clothes etc in a bag on a Sunday 
				night before a trip – this book explores the antithesis – what 
				is best way to pack objects of various shapes together in order 
				to minimize the volume. We have all seen oranges close packed in 
				a supermarket, where staggered hexagonal </span><img border=0 width=245 height=380

				0.74; a result that was first conjectured by Kepler in 1607 to 
				be optimal, but only formally proved by Hales in 1998. It was a 
				hard proof because there is a more efficient local packing where 
				12 spheres are positioned around a central sphere in an 
				icosahedral arrangement, but this can’t be tiled to fill all 
				space. The situation with disc packing in two dimensions is more 
				straightforward as the best local packing where 6 discs are 
				placed uniquely around a central disc, can be tiled to give an 
				optimal packing fraction of &nbsp;QUOTE </span><img border=0 width=28 height=34

				0.91. This has some importance to the Irish economy (see Figure 
				1) which is of importance to Denis Weaire who is a professor at 
				Trinity College, Dublin and with whom I have had the pleasure of 
				co-authoring 11 papers over the years, starting when we were

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book is written in a loose conversational style 
				that holds your attention, although you have to pause to fill in 
				some of the arguments as you read through the assorted packings 
				including soap bubbles, sands and grains, the Giant’s causeway, 
				Voronoi polyhedral, squashed peas and pomegranate pips, 
				honeycombs, concrete, M &amp; M treats, Bucky balls etc. Denis never 
				misses the chance to include an Irish reference, and why not. I 
				did not know that Boris Nickolaevich Delauney was Irish! His 
				surname comes from his Irish ancestor, Deloney, a mercenary in 
				Russia with Napoleon. Delauney is the French transliteration of 
				the name and he found a way to cover space starting with any set 
				of points now widely used in finite element analysis etc and 
				called <i>Delauney triangulation</i>. </span>

				discussed by Isaac Newton and David Gregory in 1694. Should you 
				care? Well perhaps yes, because this can be used to help 
				optimize computer codes in the presence of noise. At the other 
				extreme the largest known loosest packing of spheres in 3d that

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The highlight of the book is the story of the 
				discovery of the Weaire-Phelan structure, recently used for the 
				swimming and diving events at the 2008 Olympics. Lord Kelvin 
				posed the problem in 1887 “<i>What partitioning of space into 
				equal volumes minimizes their surface area?</i>” Kelvin’s 
				solution was to fill space with tetrakaidecahedra which is 
				perhaps more familiar as the convex Voronoi polyhedron 
				(Wigner-Seitz cell) of the body-centered-cubic lattice. In 1993, 
				Weaire and Phelan </span><img border=0 width=351 height=274
src="2008-11_files/image008.gif"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><br>
				discovered a more efficient packing using two kinds of polyhedra 
				– beating Kelvin by 0.3%, but a win is a win! It has not been 
				proved that the Weaire-Phelan structure is optimal, but it is 
				generally believed to be likely. This discovery was a triumph 
				for interdisciplinary research and was based on a known 
				clathrate structure – it would have been very hard for a 
				mathematician to come up with this. This was the structure used 
				for the water cube, with the advantage that there are only two 
				lengths of struts which meet four at a time at rigid joints. The 
				architects used 90 kilometers of steel beam to make the struts 
				and also <i>cut </i>through the structure at an angle to be 
				pleasing esthetically as shown in Figure 2 just in case you 
				missed seeing this on TV last summer.</span></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; It was also evident that our former students still wanted to learn 
		more about physics, and in particular the direction our department is 
		moving now.&nbsp; We talked about how the boundaries of physics are limited 
		only by the ability to make precise measurements, and that research is 
		becoming ever more interdisciplinary. &nbsp;ASU Physics students and faculty 
		are working now on problems in biological physics, nanoscale and 
		materials physics, and particle-astrophysics.&nbsp; Interestingly, these

&nbsp;&nbsp; I fully expect that when our current group of undergraduates come

&nbsp;&nbsp; One of our visitors asked why study physics now? I looked around

		Homecoming is such a great opportunity to meet the people who have been 
		part of ASU over the years.&nbsp; Many former students and colleagues came to 
		our tent on November 15th for the ASU Homecoming Block Party - an annual 
		event held just before the football game. Several of our outstanding 
		physics majors demonstrated and explained the science behind a marching 
		band. They engaged the community in experiments that demonstrated the 
		physics encountered by drummers, wind players and the color guard. They 
		showed how instruments are designed for tone and pitch, displayed the 
		complex patterns of sound wave resonances, and described how sound waves 
		interfere to form ‘beats.’&nbsp; The students answered questions and pointed 
		out the mathematical equations behind these experiments.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The weather was perfect and everyone had fun learning more physics. 
		To top it all off, the ASU Pep Band gathered around the tent to play the 
		fight song - making our tent the Epicenter of the Block Party.&nbsp; From my 
		perspective, this was appropriate since physics is indeed at the center 
		of science.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a pleasure spending time talking to our former students 
		about their experiences at ASU.&nbsp; Several mentioned that our discussion 
		brought back memories of the difficulty in solving physics problems, and 
		their subsequent amazement at the way simple&nbsp; mathematical 
		equations can be used to describe complex phenomena </td>

						in the establishment and development of a number of 
						concepts and directions in the field. These results were 
						pivotal to warrant the current state of the art of the 
						field and brought the whole subject to the level when it 
						grew into the main experimental project driving the 
						science of the 12 GeV energy upgrade of the Continuous 
						Electron Beam Accelerator Facility in Jefferson 
						Laboratory, Virginia. This $310 million major national

						&nbsp;<span style="color:black">The above phenomenological 
						approach to hadron’s structure has to be complimented by 
						theoretical tools based on first principle calculations. 
						To date, however, the bulk of our theoretical knowledge 
						about QCD has been gained from methods relying on some 
						kind of a perturbative expansion with respect to a small 
						parameter.&nbsp; This is the case for traditional 
						renormalizable or nonrenormalizable effective field 
						theories.&nbsp; The major challenge has always been the need 
						to devise nonperturbative techniques overcoming the 
						limitations of perturbative considerations.&nbsp; The 
						numerical framework of lattice gauge theory, which uses 
						discretized space-time, partially resolves these 
						problems, but one still lacks reliable analytical 
						methods.&nbsp; Recently, a unifying concept becoming 
						increasingly prominent is integrability. The idea of 
						integrability for interacting particle systems in 
						classical mechanics is associated with Liouville 
						theorem, which states that a mechanical system is 
						integrable provided it has as many conserved quantities 
						as degrees of freedom. Integrability is manifested in 
						diverse physical systems describing different physical 
						phenomena.&nbsp; Its story starts with the Heisenberg model 
						(1929), which describes of a chain of atoms interacting 
						via nearest-neighbor spin exchange.&nbsp; The spectrum of the 
						system was solved by Bethe in 1931 using an innovative 
						method now called the coordinate Bethe ansatz.&nbsp; Later, 
						Liouville's idea was generalized (starting with Skyrme) 
						to construct exact solutions to classical equations of 
						motion of physical nonlinear systems in one space and 
						one time dimension, e.g., the nonlinear sine-Gordon and 
						Korteweg-de Fries wave equations.&nbsp; Since then the scope 
						of this idea has grown dramatically, and implications of 
						this concept have now been extended to any classical or 
						quantum system that possesses sufficiently many 
						conserved charges such that all physical characteristics 
						can be calculated exactly.&nbsp; The conservation laws are 
						generally associated with symmetries, and not 
						necessarily Noetherian.&nbsp; More than that, the symmetries 
						may be hidden, and uncovering them is often a 
						challenging mathematical problem.&nbsp; And while in 
						principle exact solutions exist, their explicit 
						construction can be extremely nontrivial. However, if 
						these complications are circumvented, quantum field 
						theory breaks free from the limitations of perturbation 
						theory, and previously concealed properties such as, for 
						instance, strong-weak coupling dualities can be 
						revealed. Nowadays, diverse methods have been formulated 
						to identify and solve integrable systems.&nbsp; For one, the 
						original Heisenberg model, used to describe diverse 
						aspects of ferromagnetism and superconductivity, has 
						been generalized to that for a chain of particles with 
						arbitrary spin, which turns out to be relevant to 
						four-dimensional gauge theories including QCD as was 
						demonstrated by Belitsky-Braun-Derkachov-Korchemsky-Manashov 
						over a decade ago. Recently, a distant cousin of QCD - 
						the so-called maximally supersymmetric field theory – a 
						full-fledged four-dimensional theory was solved by means 
						of generalization of techniques known as the Bethe 
						Ansatz and Baxter equations to long-range interacting 
						systems. Our current work is focused on the extension of 
						this formalism to nonconformal theories like QCD. 
						Successful implementation of these ideas will not only 
						solve one of the most outstanding problems of modern 
						gauge theories – quark confinement - but also will help 
						to establish a close connection between condensed matter 
						and particle physics.</span></p>
