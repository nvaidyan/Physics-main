		Physics&nbsp; </b></i><b>invest <span style="letter-spacing: 1.1pt">in

		</span></b></font>Poet and abolitionist, John Greenleaf Whittier 
		(b.1807, d.1892) once said &quot;The great eventful Present hides the Past; 
		but through the din of its loud life hints and echoes from the life 
		behind steal in.&quot; This sentiment rings true today as students apply for 
		scholarships in the Department of Physics. Through scholarships and 
		awards, ASU Physics' past connects with its present - and future -&nbsp; in 
		several meaningful ways.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Among its honors, ASU Physics is a world leader<img border="0" src="John%20Wheatley.JPG" width="195" height="309" hspace="5" align="right" vspace="1"> 
		in electron microscopy. For more than 30 years, John C. Wheatley helped 
		develop that reputation as - among other things - the Lab Manager for 
		the John M. Cowley Center for High Resolution Electron Microscopy. <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; But perhaps more importantly, John cared deeply about the students 
		who were learning microscopy at ASU. That legacy of student focus and 
		support continues today through the John C. Wheatley Undergraduate 
		Research Scholarship which was established in 2005 by his widow, Peggy, 
		and the many faculty and friends that admired John's dedication and hard 
		work. <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Without a doubt, (this scholarship) will result in constructive 
		growth in both my academics and capabilities as a future scientist&quot; says 
		Andrew Gamalski, 2007 recipient of the John C. Wheatley Undergraduate 
		Research Scholarship.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; This scholarship is one example of how community generosity plays a 
		dual role in honoring the past while expanding opportunities for ASU 
		Physics students today. <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; Another wonderful example of the link between past and future can be 
		found in the Wally Stoelzel Physics Scholarship and Fellowship. Through 
		Mr. Stoelzel's generosity, the department honors the memory of Dr. Allen 
		Wager, former Chair of the Department of Physics, and Ms. Glenna Curtis, 
		former department secretary. The awards recognize outstanding ASU 
		graduate or undergraduate physics students who are from the United 
		States. The positive and lasting impression that Dr. Wager and Ms. 
		Curtis left on Mr. Stoelzel when he was a student in the department is 
		mirrored in the impact his scholarship has on ASU Physics students 
		today. <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; Scholarships through ASU Physics play
		<img border="0" src="Sutha%20award.JPG" width="277" height="307" hspace="5" vspace="2" align="right">a 
		crucial role in enhancing the educational experience of graduate and 
		undergraduate students. This is especially true today as the costs of a 
		quality education and the demand for outstanding scientists rise. 
		Scholarships help the student maintain their focus on the science and 
		not the finances.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sutharsan Ketharanathan, 2007 recipient of the Mark Anderson 
		Outstanding Thesis Award, reflects on how he came to be in ASU Physics 
		and the impact receiving an award has had on him. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I am originally from Sri Lanka, a third world country torn apart 
		by a long civil war. I came here - seven years ago - after a long 
		struggle, to pursue my dream to get a PhD in physics....PhD programs in 
		physics take relatively longer time (to complete) and awards like 
		this...give (me) something to be proud about...it means a lot.&quot; says 
		Ketharanathan.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The awards and scholarships also provide an important link between 
		the community and ASU Physics. This partnership has obvious benefits to 
		the recipient. But the link also benefits the community as ASU Physics 
		students go on to successful careers that shape health care, technology, 
		urban development, renewable energy, and physics education - areas that 
		impact the community in a significant way.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; As students apply for department scholarships and awards this 
		month, the &quot;hints and echoes of life behind&quot; once again steal in and 
		give us pause to reflect upon, appreciate, and anticipate great success 
		in ASU Physics.<br>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
		An education in physics enables our current students to pursue careers 
		that are associated with some of the most challenging and complex 
		problems.&nbsp; Our current students are destined to contribute in much the 
		same way as students from past years. Past students have advanced our 
		society through their contributions which ranged from building the 
		understanding of the world around us to developing the technologies that 
		affect our lives.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; I can remember my days as a physics student trying to work through 
		homework problems that seemed impossible. Eventually, most problems gave 
		way after many long hours of reviewing class notes and course texts, and 
		trying different mathematical approaches.&nbsp; One of the things that proved 
		enjoyable to me and my friends was sharing <i>how</i> we each solved the 
		most difficult problems. Often times, we used quite different 
		approaches.&nbsp; We learned from each other, and we appreciated particularly 
		novel approaches.&nbsp; Sometimes we spent an equally long time trying to 
		understand why one of our approaches did not work or differed by the 
		proverbial 2-pi.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond solving some of the most complex problems known to mankind, 
		the environment for students in ASU Physics is rich with opportunities 
		to both learn and discover and to join other students and our faculty in 
		exploring physics and participating in research projects that open new 
		doors.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; All of our students in physics are far above average, and many make 
		the tremendous effort to achieve in ways that are notable.&nbsp; We are 
		indeed privileged to be able to recognize some of these achievements 
		with scholarships and awards.&nbsp; It is gratifying to acknowledge our 
		students for their accomplishments and to see the pleasure that their 
		classmates have in celebrating their recognition.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; We all enjoy hearing of the trials, tribulations, successes and 
		celebrations during our student days.&nbsp; If you have a particularly 
		memorable moment of your days studying physics, please send me a note 
		with your story or perhaps a story of a classmate. &nbsp;(<a href="mailto:Robert.Nemanich@asu.edu">Robert.Nemanich@asu.edu</a>).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For some of us there is the possibly of helping to recognize our 
		tremendous students.&nbsp; We have several opportunities to put your 
		generosity to good use to the benefit of our students.&nbsp; I hope that you 
		will consider this invitation.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; You can find more information how you can support ASU Physics 
		students at our website -

		call Margaret (Peg) Stuart or me with your questions or comments.&nbsp; Any 
		contribution makes a difference. I think you will enjoy supporting the 
		dedicated students of ASU Physics, and I know they will appreciate your 
		recognition and involvement. </p>
