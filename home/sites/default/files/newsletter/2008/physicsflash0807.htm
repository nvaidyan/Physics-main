					<p class="MsoNormal">The May 2008 Region 10 Conference 
					of the National Academic Advising Association (NACADA) 
					opened with a keynote address from Dr. Adam Johnston, 
					Associate Professor of Physics at Weber State University and 
					a leader in the area of science education reform. Weber&#8217;s 
					speech focused on inspiring intellectual curiosity, 
					improving communication, encouraging self-<br>
					authorship, and <br>
					understanding <br>
					advising as teaching.<br>
					The address was <br>
					timely and moving <br>
					for each of the <br>
					345 conference <br>
					participants who <br>
					attended the three-<br>
					day conference held<br>
&nbsp;in Park City, Utah.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among those <br>
					participants were <br>
					Karen Burrington <br>
					and Sabrina <br>
					Mathues from <br>
					ASU Physics. <br>
					Mathues serves as <br>
					ASU Physics&#8217; Undergraduate Advisor and 
					Coordinator of Under-graduate Programs. Burrington is 
					Coordinator to the ASU Physics&#8217; General Studies program as 
					well as the Master of Natural Science program. Both women 
					deal with a large segment of the physics student population 
					in their daily work at ASU. More and more of their success 
					lies in a keen understanding of advising strategies and 
					techniques. <br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a call for travel grants went out to ASU 
					departments seeking professional development opportunities 
					for advisors, ASU Physics jumped at the chance. <br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;It really was a no-brainer,&#8221; states Peg Stuart, 
					Department Manager of ASU Physics &#8220;With the increase in 
					responsibilities and workload that staff have in providing 
					comprehensive service to all of our student populations, you 
					have to invest in your staff. You do everything you can to 
					equip your staff with the latest and most effective 
					information. Because in the end, we are investing not only 
					in student retention and success, but in the quality and 
					effectiveness of our staff. A university cannot succeed one 
					without the other.&#8221;<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The conference theme - <i>Making Advising Count: Turning 
					the Ordinary into the Extraordinary</i> &ndash; was relevant for 
					both Burrington and Mathues&#8217; respective areas in ASU Physics 
					as well as their scholarly interests in education. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#8220;During the breakout sessions we heard from speakers 
					representing small and large universities,&#8221; commented 
					Mathues.&nbsp;&#8220;It was interesting to share experiences and 
					compare notes with advisors and advising administrators from 
					different college environments.&#8221;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Mathues found the session <i>When Dreams and Realities 
					Collide: Helping Underprepared and Low-Achieving Students 
					Face Academic</i></p></td>

					<i>Challenges</i> to be among the most impressive conference 
					sessions.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It&#8217;s hard to see a student who is 
					absolutely passionate about the material that they are 
					studying, still run up against hurdle after hurdle&ndash; either 
					personally or academically,&#8221; <br>
					says Mathues. &#8220;This session afforded me some insights 
					that I plan to apply in my day-to-day interactions with such 
					students.&#8221;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					Burrington was equally impressed with the quality and 
					range of topics discussed. One session, titled <i>Advisors 
					as Teachers: Creating the Conditions for Learning,</i> 
					shared helpful techniques on how advisors and 
					student-centered university personnel can better understand 
					and help &#8220;at- risk&#8221; students succeed, and incorporate 
					problem-solving strategies to help keep these students 
					focused and on track. <br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;By incorporating these simple, effective strategies to 
					my interaction with students, I can better connect with them 
					which results in better retention and student success,&#8221; says 
					Burrington. &#8220;This session reminded me how important our 
					advising role is in every student&#8217;s journey.&#8221;<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The conference also addressed complicated issues in the 
					session titled <i>From Advocate to Enforcer: Balancing 
					Competing Roles</i>. In this session, advisors shared 
					interesting opinions on how to equally balance the advisor 
					role of advocating for the student while still adhering to 
					university policies. Through the use of real scenarios, 
					candid discussion, and best practices participants came away 
					with strategies to turn an uncomfortable situation into one 
					that is productive and manageable.<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;I&#8217;m so thankful to the ASU Office of Student and 
					Academic Programs for making this funding opportunity 
					available to departments,&#8221; says Stuart. &#8220;The knowledge and 
					experience they (Burrington and Mathues) have gained from 
					this conference will have an immediate and positive impact 
					on our students. Making that positive impact in the lives of 
					students is why we do what we do every day.&#8221; &nbsp;<br>

				With a research-intensive area like physics, the Information 
				Technology staff can literally make or break a department&#8217;s 
				success. ASU Physics is fortunate to have an in-house IT team 
				that works directly with physics faculty, staff, and students 
				while also acting as liaisons to UTO for broader IT issues.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A small team which includes IT manager Gary Childress, 
				Web Developer Michael Yakerson, and part-time IT support staff 
				John Huffer, Physics IT serves nearly 100 faculty, research 
				professionals, and staff in addition to graduate and 
				undergraduate students in physics. Needless to say, they are a 
				busy trio. This past year, Childress led his team in providing 
				and managing innovative and practical solutions that impact 
				teaching, learning, research, marketing, and recruitment.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One project that impacted everyone within the 
				department was the acquisition of a new file storage solution. 
				Physics IT worked with UTO to transfer to a new file storage 
				service which utilizes the CIFS file sharing protocol. The new 
				service allows for easy access from nearly any type of operating 
				system from Windows to Mac to Linux. The change increased ASU 
				Physics&#8217; capacity for file storage while at the same time 
				reducing costs and overhead associated with providing a secure 
				environment through which that information is stored.&nbsp; Physics 
				IT plans to increase storage capacity again to handle the file 
				storage and backup needs of the department as utilization of the 
				service increases.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASU Physics IT also been extremely involved 
				in helping administrative and instructional staff move processes 
				and systems from a paper format to a web format. The result has 
				been an increase in efficiency, access, visibility and 
				engagement. One example of a new web-based process is 
				recruitment. In the past, a faculty search meant piles and piles 
				of applications and letters of recommendation &ndash; all of which had 
				to be organized, copied, made available to a search committee, 
				and then archived for three years. For administrative staff, the 
				process was time-consuming. For faculty, access was limited and 
				cumbersome. For the department in general, the files took up 
				space &ndash; something no department has an abundance of. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASU Physics IT, together with Department Manager Peg 
				Stuart, designed a web-based application submission database 
				that allowed applicants to upload necessary documents through 
				the website. Search committees could view the documents at their 
				convenience through a secure site and even participate in a 
				search committee discussion board on each applicant. The 
				database allowed staff to retrieve contact and application 
				information quickly, categorize applications as complete or 
				incomplete, and monitor search committee progress. </td>
				<td valign="top" width="323" style="text-align:justify;">
				The applications are archived digitally with 
				no impact on space. It is the kind of application that is a 
				win-win for everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to web-based recruitment, ASU Physics IT 
				has worked with staff to develop other applications that 
				streamline textbook ordering and TA/RA assignments among others. 
				The beauty of the collaboration between staff and an in-house IT team 
				<img border="0" src="2008-07_files/Gary.JPG" width="317" height="265" vspace="5" style="word-spacing: 0; text-align: left; line-height: 100%"><br>
				<i><font style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: 700">ASU Physics IT 
				manager, Gary Childress, works with Deborah LaBranche in the 
				business office on web applications.</font></i><p>is 
				that modifications and upgrades are made as needed since both 
				groups work in the same building.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In looking to the future of web design, information sharing 
				and sharing of responsibilities on the web are becoming 
				increasingly important and necessary. ASU Physics IT is 
				currently in the final stages of preparing the department web 
				site to move to a new environment hosted through UTO called 
				Drupal. This new system will help reduce development time for 
				web-based applications while at the same time allowing for a 
				richer user experience. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, for information to be updated on the Physics 
				website, staff responsible for the content must interface with 
				the web developer to address issues such as formatting of code 
				and graphics manipulation. Because of the user-friendly nature 
				of the new Drupal environment, staff can more easily upload and 
				manage content themselves reducing the turn around time on 
				getting information out to faculty, students, and the public. 
				&nbsp;Since Drupal also allows for Really Simple Syndication (RSS) 
				feeds, people outside the department can subscribe to the ASU 
				Physics site and be instantly updated on news and events. &nbsp;ASU 
				Physics IT plans to continue brainstorming ways in which Drupal 
				can positively impact ASU students, faculty, and staff. </p>

		facilitates many workshops throughout the week that focus on their role 
		in teaching, understanding the undergraduate curriculum, grading, and 
		lab/recitation responsibilities. Carl has provided inspiration and 
		direction to numerous incoming graduate classes.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Undergraduate Coordinator and Academic Advisor Sabrina Mathues 
		takes the lead in recruiting and advising our undergraduate majors. Her 
		dedication and attention to detail have resulted in significant growth 
		in the majors program over the last two years.&nbsp; The students really 
		appreciate the way she is there to help each of them understand the 
		process and the program that they desire.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In many of our lectures, our students are amazed by demonstrations 
		of physical phenomena that are brought to life right there in the 
		classroom. Behind the scene, rooms full of equipment are organized and 
		assembled by Wayne Easterling and Jim Krider to develop each of these 
		lecture demonstrations.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Physics is a quantitative science and our laboratories provide 
		students hands on experience to characterize physical phenomena with 
		precise measurements and then to build mathematical models that describe 
		the results.&nbsp; Before each laboratory, Iwonna Rzanek works with our 
		graduate teaching assistants to organize laboratories so that they 
		actually work!&nbsp; <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Banks of computers are set up by Gary Childress and his team with 
		the software that will enable students to apply the most advanced 
		mathematical approaches. As detailed in this issue of the <i>Physics 
		Flash</i>, Gary and his team do so much in support of teaching and 
		research through ASU Physics. (see <i>Atypical IT)</i><br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The start of the semester is the peak of excitement as the whole 
		team makes final adjustments and welcomes our students to the 200+ 
		sessions where the principles of physics are discussed and explored, and 
		our students apply their new knowledge to solve some of the most complex 
		problems ever posed.&nbsp; The knowledge gained from these exercises may well 
		be at the foundation of society&#8217;s most critical challenges of energy, 
		sustainability, defense and health. <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is truly a team effort, and every one of our staff, student 
		assistants and faculty deserves our appreciation for their dedication to 
		one of the largest shows of physics on earth. <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Congratulations to each of them on a job well done, and best wishes 
		in the upcoming academic year!</p>

		It is a singular pleasure to watch how our staff, student workers, 
		graduate student assistants and faculty work together to bring the 
		principles of physics to our students and to the ASU community.&nbsp; It is 
		truly a collaborative effort that involves multiple people with a wide 
		range of responsibilities. Often much of the planning and maintenance 
		for an exemplary physics program happens behind the scenes and goes 
		largely unnoticed by students and those outside the department. But the 
		teamwork and dedication is there and is exemplified through so many of 
		our staff.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every semester over 4,000 students enroll in ASU Physics courses.&nbsp; 
		The instructor-student interactions that occur in each class meeting 
		represent the culmination of a tremendous effort which begins nearly a 
		year before the semester starts.&nbsp; Our faculty initiate the process with 
		Associate Chair and Regents&#8217; Professor David Smith where they define the 
		courses that will inspire our majors and graduate students, and provide 
		the foundational knowledge of physics for ASU students in majors across 
		the campus.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Working closely with General Studies Coordinator, Karen Burrington, 
		and Instructional Resource Manager, Tim Cook, Dave develops a schedule 
		of lecture, recitation and laboratory courses, The three then work with 
		the University to schedule the rooms and assign a faculty or student 
		assistant to each of the over 200 lectures, recitations, and 
		laboratories taught through ASU Physics. Making these assignments is a 
		tremendous undertaking.<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the weeks before the semester begins, Dave, Karen, and Tim 
		carefully watch the student enrollments and often make significant 
		adjustments to the schedule.&nbsp; The past few years have seen an increase 
		in enrollments &ndash; at times fairly dramatic. As these increases impact the 
		course schedule, Karen, Dave, and Tim adjust and readjust to ensure the 
		best use of time, space, and resources. <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the start of the semester, our student workers Shelly Robinson 
		and Raiza Dottin help students make last minute adjustments to their 
		course schedule. Both Shelly and Raiza help students quickly get the 
		information they need to register or modify their schedules. So many 
		students have commented on the efficiency of our student worker staff.</td>
