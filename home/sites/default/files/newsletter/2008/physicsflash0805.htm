		</font></b>As composites of three quarks, protons have a spectrum of 
		excited states that reflect the interactions of those quarks bound 
		within them. However, many of the details of this spectrum are still a 
		mystery, including what the energies of those states are, what the 
		quantum numbers of those states might be, and so forth. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ASU Meson Physics Group, working with collaborators 
		from around the world, completed a collection of experiments in February 
		that will be critical in determining the details of the excited states 
		of the proton. The experiments were conducted at the Thomas Jefferson 
		National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) using three complex 
		devices: (1) the &#8220;photon tagger&#8221;, which the group helped design and 
		continues to maintain, provided polarized photons with energies ranging 
		up to 2.3 GeV; (2) the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS), the 
		most complex detector ever built f<img border="0" src="2008-05_files/CLAS_Spectrometer.jpg" width="450" height="339" align="right" style="float: right; word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; border-top: 5px solid #FFD680; border-bottom: 5px solid #FFD680; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" hspace="0">or 
		nuclear physics research; and (3) a new &#8220;frozen spin&#8221; polarized 
		cryogenic hydrogen target, &#8220;FROST.&#8221; The combination of polarized photons 
		and polarized protons will allow access to information about the 
		distribution of angular momentum within the proton. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The photon tagger uses a large magnet with a 75-ton 
		iron yoke, a detector focal plane with several hundred scintillation 
		counters, and a tiny oriented diamond crystal to generate a 
		well-collimated polarized photon beam by using the coherent 
		bremsstrahlung process. The polarized photons then travel to where they 
		interact and excite the protons contained within the FROST target cell, 
		where the proton spins are kept aligned by a holding magnetic field 
		while being kept at a very low temperature only slightly above absolute 
		zero (25 mK). The CLAS detector, which surrounds the target cell, 
		contains a set of six superconducting coils that produce a strong 
		toroidal magnetic field in which a series of detectors tracks the paths 
		of charged particles emerging from the target region, yielding 
		information about the de-excitation of the excited protons. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Truly enormous quantities of data are produced during 
		typical CLAS experiments, and this running period was no different, 
		producing several terabytes of data. Group members who participated in 
		the experiment, which began running essentially &#8220;24-7&#8221; in October 2007, 
		included Graduate Research Associate Patrick Collins, Research 
		Professors Michael Dugger and Eugene Pasyuk, and Professor Barry 
		Ritchie. Pasyuk served as &#8220;super-run-coordinator&#8221; during the runs, being 
		the principal liaison between the accelerator staff and the experiment 
		and as the overall expert for any problems that arose. Dugger also 
		served as run coordinator during a portion of the experiment. Additional 
		participants in the experiments included other members of the CLAS 
		Collaboration, which built, operates, and maintains the various pieces 
		of hardware used in experiments within Hall B at Jefferson Lab; the 
		collaboration consists of an international group of more than 200 
		scientists from over 40 institutions. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Initial analysis of the data has begun, and should form 
		the basis for several papers and dissertations over the next few years.

			It is hard to believe that it has been 12 whole months since we last 
			gathered for an Awards &amp; Recognition Ceremony. So much has happened 
			that we can be proud of. Among the highlights:<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; font-weight: normal"> 
			We have substantially enhanced our collaborative research 
			environments in Biological Physics, Nanoscale Science, and 
			Particle-Astro Physics. Our goal is to develop research environments 
			where students, faculty and distinguished researchers openly 
			interact and share concepts, ideas and critical analysis as they 
			work together to build the basis of knowledge that will advance our 
			society. Our research programs are indeed driven by student 
			involvement. Our students first learn and then they discover and 
			innovate and substantially contribute to advancing the forefront of 
			knowledge. </span>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; ">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			</span>We hosted a very impressive colloquium series, and 
			Distinguished Lecturer series, and three weekly seminar series in 
			biological physics, nanoscale physics, and particle astrophysics - 
			once again allowing our students and faculty the opportunity to 
			interface with quality scientists from all over the world. 
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; ">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our faculty have played leadership roles in 
			the development of their fields as evidenced by their hosting of 
			conferences that drew the scientific community to ASU. This is 
			ALWAYS a good thing as it brings ASU Physics to the forefront of 
			scientific discussion and collaboration. 
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; ">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We continue to make progress in our efforts 
			to expand research programs - particularly through collaborative 
			projects. This is a key component of our departmental vision and our 
			faculty are dedicated to focusing and enhancing collaborative 
			interactions.&nbsp; We have started developing plans to build 
			interactions with national laboratories and facilities and we have 
			set a focus to build inter American collaborations to solve problems 
			faced by our region.&nbsp; I believe that ASU is uniquely positioned in 
			this area. 
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; ">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In every measurable way, our educational programs 
			are growing - perhaps a better word is burgeoning! 
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; ">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our undergraduate program - under the 
			leadership of Professor Mike Treacy and Undergraduate Programs 
			Coordinator Sabrina Mathues - witnessed a near doubling of the 
			number of incoming freshman in Fall 2007. This is remarkable and can 
			be attributed to not only our growing reputation, but also to the 
			remarkable efforts of Mike, Sabrina, and the rest of the 
			Undergraduate Program Committee.<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; ">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our graduate program has had exceptional 
			incoming student classes for the last two years. Next Fall&#8217;s 
			incoming class represents the highest average GRE Scores in our 
			department&#8217;s history (and possibly in the history of the 
			University). The word is out and we are beginning to attract the 
			cream of the crop. Thanks to Professor Bruce Doak, Graduate Programs 
			Coordinator Eboni Anderson, and the Graduate Program Committee.<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; ">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every semester nearly 3500 students learn 
			the concepts of Physics in their General Studies courses and 
			laboratories. This past year, we have developed an organizational 
			structure focused on student success, we have enhanced the 
			laboratories with web based lab submissions and we have initiated 
			the development of web based&nbsp; course introductions to sharpen our 
			students mathematical and analysis skills. The result is a continued 
			increase in enrollment and a student-centered service model for 
			students from all across the campus. Thanks to Dr. Carl Covatto and 
			General Studies Coordinator Karen Burrington for their tremendous 
			work on defining and understanding the needs of our general studies 
			courses and students.<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; ">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Master of Natural Science program 
			brings together high school teachers from Arizona and around the US 
			to become skilled at the modeling approaches developed at ASU.&nbsp; 
			Thanks to Professor Bob Culbertson, Director of the MNS Program in 
			Physics and to Dr. Jane Jackson for helping to coordinate the 
			program.<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; ">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This last year under John Venables care and 
			attention we completed the planning of a new degree program - the 
			Professional Science Masters&#8217; in Nanoscience.&nbsp; We expect that the 
			PSM-Nano will provide a strong and hands-on education in nanoscience 
			in courses and projects by leaders of the field.&nbsp; Thanks to John for 
			helping at every step of the way.&nbsp;<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; ">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We celebrate the hiring of new faculty and 
			the excellence of existing faculty. We brought two new faces to the 
			faculty last year - Professors Cecilia Lunardini and Robert Ros both 
			of whom have hit the ground running. Our faculty continues to grow 
			with the recent hiring of Dr. Sara Vaiana who will start next 
			January as an Assistant Professor. We look forward to the 
			interesting ways all of our new faculty will help define ASU 
			Physics.<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; ">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We celebrate the achievements of all 
			physics faculty who continue to do remarkable research work while 
			mentoring and teaching our students. 
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; ">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In particular, we recognize Professor 
			Michael Treacy who was just awarded the College of Liberal Arts &amp; 
			Sciences Quality Teaching Award. To many of us here, this comes as 
			no surprise - we&#8217;ve always known of Mike&#8217;s outstanding commitment to 
			teaching and students. Congratulations Mike!<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; ">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also recognize our two newest Regents 
			Professors - Stuart Lindsay and Otto Sankey. What an honor not only 
			for them individually, but for ASU Physics in general. This speaks 
			volumes about our faculty! Congratulations Stuart and Otto - we are 
			very proud of your many successes in research and teaching!<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			There are many more successes to note, but we would be here until 
			midnight.&nbsp; Hopefully, you get a sense of the tremendous work, 
			dedication, and creativity that has occurred in ASU Physics. We 
			appreciate and are very proud of each and every contribution.<br>

		Congratulations to ASU Physics graduate student Shuai Chang</b> who has 
		been accepted to participate in the German Academic Exchange Service 
		(DAAD) program this summer. The DAAD program invites bachelors, masters, 
		and PhD students from the U.S. and Canada to participate in a 
		professional summer internship program in Germany. Program placements 
		provide students the opportunity to live and work in an international 
		context, to gain confidence in their practical and professional skills, 
		and to improve their German. The internship should be a source of mutual 
		cultural and professional enrichment for both the interns and their host 
		companies. Through the internship, Chang will conduct detailed work 
		involving the use of reflectometry to characterize thin film adsorption 
		as well as rewriting of software for data acquisition. Chang is a member
