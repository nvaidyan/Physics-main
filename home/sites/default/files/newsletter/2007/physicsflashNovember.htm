			measurements of a decaying double-neutron-star system that revealed 
			the action of gravity waves, to a 2004 space experiment that tested 
			whether spacetime &#8220;does the twist&#8221;. A revolution in astronomy and 
			technology led to a renaissance of general relativity in the 1960s 
			and to a systematic program to try to verify its predictions.

		Physics welcomes Assistant Professor Cecilia Lunardini to the faculty. 
		Dr. Lunardini is involved with theoretical research at the interface of 
		nuclear physics, particle physics and astrophysics.&nbsp;&nbsp; After completing 
		her PhD at SISSA-ISAS in Trieste, Italy, she held a postdoc position at 
		the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton followed by a five year 
		fellowship at the Institute for Nuclear Theory in Seattle.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently,&nbsp; her research activities focus on neutrinos - particles 
		that are very light, interact very weakly with matter, and exhibit 
		exotic properties like the famous phenomenon of oscillations. Neutrinos 
		are produced in stars like our sun, and reach the Earth even from the 
		distant Cosmos.&nbsp;&nbsp; Enormous quantities of neutrinos are produced when a 
		star explodes as a supernova - a phenomenon that is still mysterious in 
		many respects.&nbsp; Dr. Lunardini&#8217;s work focuses on the intriguing fact 
		that, while inaccessible to telescopes, the interior of a supernova can 
		be probed with neutrinos. Thus, neutrinos are unique carriers of 
		information about how stars explode.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to physics, Dr. Lunardini is passionate about classical 
		music, women&#8217;s issues and cultural diversity. <br>

		Physics</font></span> One nanometer (one billionth of a meter) 
		corresponds to a distance of about five atoms in a row in a crystalline 
		solid.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; It is intriguing how words that have become important in physics 
		seem to quickly find their way into our everyday lives.&nbsp; We are probably 
		all aware of the ubiquitous use of the term &#8216;nano,&#8217; and in some way this 
		has been related to the increasingly important fields of nanoscience and 
		nanotechnology. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (<span style="color: #330033"><a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.nano.gov/">http://www.nano.gov/</a></span>)&nbsp; 
		began at about the beginning of this decade, and it has grown to be one 
		of the most significant areas of interdisciplinary research. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The term nanoscale has come to mean the range of 1 to 100 
		nanometers, but the real focus of nanoscale science has been the 
		integration of physical, chemical and biological materials to achieve 
		new properties and phenomena. The electronics industry is already 
		manufacturing with nanoscale precision and is indeed an advancing 
		nanotechnology.&nbsp; The integration of chemical and biological molecules 
		with solid particles or electronics holds a similar potential to impact 
		medical and security related applications.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of the faculty and students in ASU Physics have been 
		significantly involved with nanoscale science.&nbsp; The department offers a 
		new course (PHY 191) for undergraduates to learn about the &#8220;Big World of 
		Nano.&#8221; Our researchers use the most advanced electron microscopy and 
		surface microscopy techniques, and they have explored new ways to use 
		chemical and physical effects to organize and synthesize nanomaterials. 
		Other faculty and students are developing and applying new theoretical 
		approaches which consider interactions over a range of length scales.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The excitement for us is to bring all of these efforts together to 
		form a cohesive group and education program. The most recent step to 
		focusing our efforts is the initiation of a seminar series on Nanoscale 
		Science which has been organized by John Shumway. In an equally exciting 
		development, John Venables has led the formation of a new Professional 
		Science Master&#8217;s degree in Nanoscience.&nbsp; Stay tuned to the Flash and our 
		website to learn the latest of <i>Nanoscience</i> at ASU.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

		and Mari Koerner, Dean of College Teacher Education and Leadership, four 
		new programs were developed and put in place. The committee was composed 
		of multi-campus faculty from CLAS, the Mary Lou Fulton College of 
		Education, the Fulton School of Engineering, and the College of Teacher 
		Education and Leadership. With Physics leading the way and joined by 
		Chemistry, Biology, and Mathematics, new dual degree programs were 
		designed to lead to both B.S. and B.A.E. (Bachelor of Arts in Education) 
		Degrees in four years. With 121 credit hours, the Physics dual degree 
		program is the closest of the group to the 120-credit-hour goal.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The BS/BAE Physics program includes both the full B.S. (Option 2) 
		requirements and the BAE (physics) requirements. This is a compact yet 
		rigorous dual degree program. Unlike the BAE alone, students in the new 
		program will be prepared for graduate school in physics as well as 
		certified to teach physics in secondary schools.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not stopping here, ASU is exploring the possibility of creating 
		entirely new programs to improve the training of future science and math 
		teachers. Stay tuned! <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For more information on the BS/BAE Physics program please contact
