			basement 
of the Bateman Physical Sciences F-wing, one probably thinks of complex, 
carefully-tooled components to a microscope or telescope or AT LEAST something 
remotely scientific. Ordinarily, you&#8217;d be right. But the shop occasionally 
receives requests slightly off the beaten path. The ASU Mechanical Instrument 
Shop is a full service machine shop that supports the research and teaching 
facilities of the Physics Department and College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. 
Recently, however, the shop was approached by Dosun Shin of Industrial Design 
and Dan Collins of School of Art to fabricate the Hugh Downs Excellence in 
Communications Award which would be presented to the first recipient of
			<img border="0" src="award.JPG" width="258" height="151" align="left">the award: 
Larry King. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With only three weeks to finish the award, ASU 
instrument maker Zoltan Farkas spearheaded the project. &nbsp;Due to the complex 
profile of the award, Zoltan fabricated the three &#8220;fluted&#8221; parts of the award 
from a solid billet of aluminum with the aid of Pro Engineer &nbsp;and Feature Cam 
software packages. He then machined it on &nbsp;the shop&#8217;s Bridgeport CNC Machining 
Center. The block was set up in the machine, and both sides were surface milled 
to create the desired profiles. &nbsp;The base was

			</span></font><font color="#330033" face="Times New Roman">Certainly one of the most 
			rewarding aspects of science is the interaction with colleagues from 
			around the world.&nbsp; I can remember back to some of my first 
			scientific conferences where I was surprised to find that anyone 
			even cared about the rather obscure topic I was working on at the 
			time. It was intriguing to me to see that researchers on quite 
			different areas found that my research could be relevant to them.&nbsp; I 
			also found the opposite was true.&nbsp; For most researchers, the 
			possibility of presenting our ideas to colleagues is important to 
			both learn their perspectives, to validate our approach, and to 
			learn if the research has broader relevance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to present our 
			research results at conferences in Osaka, Japan, and Hong Kong, 
			China.&nbsp; Both meetings turned into special events as I had the chance 
			to appreciate the perspectives and comments of my colleagues from 
			around the world.&nbsp; In Japan I described research on a process to 
			convert heat into electrical energy using then films of diamond 
			while the second conference presentation focused on how proteins 
			bind to sensor materials.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were so many opportunities to gain insight from 
			our colleagues.&nbsp; One day I went to lunch with a group of researchers 
			from Japan, and we discussed the process of incorporating impurities 
			into the diamond films.&nbsp; It is meetings like this that we talk about 
			the complexities of the experiments that are just not evident in the 
			publications. Similarly, in Hong Kong we had many discussions trying 
			to understand which effects were most important for proteins to bind 
			to surfaces. Here several of the most knowledgeable researchers in 
			the world were trying to understand the data and the implications. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some of the evenings, groups of colleagues gathered 
			and went out to explore the cities.&nbsp; As you can imagine we enjoyed 
			some very interesting meals.&nbsp; The discussion often focused on the 
			challenges of education and research in universities in different 
			places in the world which proved to be rather similar everywhere.&nbsp; 
			It was interesting to hear that many of our colleagues had heard 
			about the interdisciplinary approaches at ASU, and they seemed to be 
			enthusiastic about the possibilities of a growing and vibrant 
			physics department that addressed problems beyond the traditional 
			boundaries.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To me these are some of the best of times, discussing 
			science, reflecting on the way universities work, and just being 
			with friends from around the world.<br>

						<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On his deathbed in 1879, 
					Clark Maxwell wrote a referee&#8217;s report on a new paper by 
					George FitzGerald, applying Maxwell&#8217;s theory to the 
					reflection and refraction of electromagnetic waves. Maxwell 
					was dead of cancer before George read it. In those last 
					months Maxwell (who had designed the Cavendish Laboratory 
					and was its first Professor) had also got about half way 
					through revising a new edition of his book on 
					electrodynamics. It did not contain &#8220;Maxwell&#8217;s equations&#8221; as 
					we know them - instead (see the current Dover edition) we 
					find 11 equations, some scalar, and some in quaternion form. 
					Before he died, Maxwell, who wrote much light verse and 
					poetry, had used a telephone and heard a primitive cylinder 
					phonograph, but did not live to see the discovery of radio 
					waves in 1888.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a remarkable book - perhaps the 
					best history of science text I&#8217;ve read, Koestler&#8217;s 
					&#8220;Sleepwalkers&#8221; , Rhodes&#8217; &#8220;Making of the atom bomb&#8221; and 
					Kuhn&#8217;s &#8220;Structure of Scientific Revolutions&#8221; 
					notwithstanding. It brings vividly to life the excitement 
					surrounding the discovery of radio waves by Hertz, and the 
					personalities involved with developing the relevant theory 
					following Maxwell&#8217;s death - Fitzgerald, Lodge, Poynting, 
					Larmor, Stokes, and Heaviside. But it is the mathematically&nbsp; 
					gifted Heaviside (1850-1925; cf generalized functions, 
					Heaviside layer) who emerges as the unsung hero of this 
					saga, despite the flair and fertile imagination of 
					Fitzgerald (retarded potentials, &#8220;relativistic&#8221; contraction) 
					and the crucial confidence given to their groping ideas by 
					Herz&#8217;s experiment.&nbsp; The book asks profound questions about 
					how abstract new theories arise, and contains and discusses 
					all the relevant equations in modern notation, including a 
					discussion of the key question of whether fields or 
					potentials are more fundamental.&nbsp; Contrary to what we teach, 
					we learn that Maxwell did not predict the existence of radio 
					waves. The book is based on close analysis, much of it 
					mathematical, of the hundreds of letters we still have 
					between Fitzgerald, Heaviside and Lodge.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maxwell&#8217;s theory was based on Faraday&#8217;s idea of 
					stresses and strains set up by charges in a surrounding 
					invisible elastic medium (the ether) - the experimentalist 
					Faraday is therefore the originator of field theory. It was 
					Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) who introduced vortices into 
					this medium to explain the Faraday rotation effect.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maxwell made these vortices the basis of his theory, 
					which added &#8220;idler wheels&#8221; between them. These eventually 
					produced&nbsp; the displacement 
					current, a verygreat discovery, which allows propagating 
						solutions. He himself considered his finding that this 
						medium supported waves which traveled with the velocity 
						of light,&nbsp; which could be predicted from static, 
						known electromagnetic constants, to be his</span></p>

					(Yet, when he derived this famous result in Edinburgh, he 
					had to wait, for family reasons, to the end of the summer in 
					great anticipation before catching the steam-train up to 
					London to get values of the constants needed to test his 
					result!). But Maxwell probably never realized that an 
					oscillating current would emit em waves, or dealt with any 
					em waves other than light.<br></span><!--[if gte vml 1]><v:shapetype

					equation&#8221; was also important. (It is now used , for example, 
					to describe&nbsp; neurons firing;&nbsp; then it was used to explain 
					delays on the new transatlantic submarine telegraph, where 
					morse code did not travel, as expected, at the speed of 
					light). This equation&nbsp; later suggested a propagating wave 
					solution of Maxwell&#8217;s equation. But Heaviside made a 
					crucial&nbsp; improvement to Kelvin&#8217;s result&nbsp; by incorporating 
					inductance, and so developed the condition for 
					distortionless propagation - he described this work as the 
					&#8220;Royal Road&#8221; to understanding electromagnetic wave 
					propagation. Kelvin himself may never have read Maxwell&#8217;s 
					book, and, having contributed so much to electrodynamics in 
					the early stages, remained skeptical of&nbsp;&nbsp; Maxwell&#8217;s 
					equations to the end of his life in 1907.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heaviside, a working-class recluse who never 
					really had a job, who never married,&nbsp; and who started life 
					as a telegraph boy, devoted his life to Maxwell&#8217;s work 
					through his close friendship with the eminent Prof. 
					Fitzgerald in Dublin. Archie Howie, who gave our Physics 
					colloquium recently, recalled conversations with a colleague 
					who had visited Heaviside in the nineteen twenties.&nbsp; 
					Heaviside was the first to derive &#8220;Maxwell&#8217;s equations&#8221; in 
					their modern form (in 1884) - class prejudice and an early 
					rejection from Phil. Mag. caused him to publish this (in 
					1885) and all his highly mathematical work in the 
					telegrapher&#8217;s trade journal &#8220;The Electrician&#8221;. By 1900 his 
					modern version of Maxwell&#8217;s equations had become widely 
					accepted, and so, despite fierce opposition from the head 
					of Britain&#8217;s telegraphy organization, Heaviside was 
					eventually recognized at the end of his life with Fellowship 
					in the Royal Society, and his papers&nbsp; accepted in leading 
					journals due to FitzGerald&#8217;s support. Heaviside&#8217;s book 
					(&#8220;Electromagnetic Theory&#8221; 1912) became the Bible 
					of the field, and the first modern EM text.&nbsp; Oliver 
						Lodge, the experimentalist, was also a strong proponent 
						of Maxwell&#8217;s ideas, and through him we get a good 
						feeling of </span></td>

						</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Cambridge when it was known 
					that Maxwell&#8217;s book first appeared in the local bookshop. 
					(Green&#8217;s book on String Theory had similar impact, but was 
					far less technical - Cambridge was a much more 
					specialized community in those days). But the &#8220;Woodstock&#8221; 
					conference of the era was in at Bath, UK in 1888, when 
					Hertz&#8217;s discovery was announced. We get a vivid picture of 
					excited debate in the corridors, with Kelvin always the 
					skeptic,&nbsp; while the Young Turks defend their more abstract 
					mathematical ideas, defending the propagation of waves in 
					vacuum or the ether.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two points struck me forcibly on finishing this book. 
					Although in his&nbsp; last paper on electrodynamics, Maxwell 
					ignored the mechanical scaffold and used purely Lagrangian 
					methods, we are left to wonder if his theory could ever have 
					&nbsp;been developed without it. Fitzgerald described a simpler 
					mechanical model for the ether than Maxwell&#8217;s - a 
					two-dimensional array of wheels, each of which is connected 
					to its four neighbors by rubber bands. Is it a coincidence 
					that the&nbsp; solution to the elasticity equations for this 
					apparatus gives us Maxwell&#8217;s equations? We are led again to 
					the question Frank Wilczek asks in the current issue of 
					Physics Today, quoting Wigner : &#8220; What is behind the 
					unreasonable and miraculous accuracy of mathematics as a 
					description of reality&#8221;. Wilczek goes on to cite the power 
					of non-mathematical ideas in science (Darwin, the atomic 
					theory in chemistry) and Feynman&#8217;s vision of a future 
					expanded human intellect capable of understanding the 
					qualitative content of equations. Maxwell evidently had 
					highly developed skills of both kinds.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the theoretical 
					difficulties they faced in 1880 were enormous. Remember that 
					Maxwell worked only in the Coulomb gage of electrostatics, 
					which required instantaneous propagation of potentials (but 
					allowed fields finite time to propagate). It was FitzGerald, 
					trusting his mechanical model, who came up with our modern 
					&#8220;Lorentz gage&#8221; which allows both fields and potentials to 
					propagate with the speed of light. Heaviside also had 
					realized this earlier. This was one of&nbsp; the hot topics, and 
					the fundamental issue debated at Bath that summer. By 
					focusing on the fields, and eliminating potentials , 
					Heaviside was soon after able to derive the modern Maxwell&#8217;s 
					equations. (He also introduced the constitutive equations) . 
					But the hot topic of Bath 1888 is still with us - when we 
					think of the Aharonov-Bohm experiment and the work of Wu and 
					Yang, potentials have again become fundamental, in
