		semester just began and suddenly we are at the midpoint of the academic 
		year and the end of the calendar year.&nbsp; We have just congratulated 
		our outstanding Fall graduating class of seven BS, five MS, and six PhD 
		recipients.&nbsp; Dean Wheeler spoke at commencement about the dynamics 
		of our society and how many of our students will be seeking jobs in 
		positions that did not exist five years ago.&nbsp; The student speaker, 
		Leigh Ann Thagard, a graduate in Biochemistry, challenged the graduates 
		to find their passion, to take risks, and to continue learning for the 
		rest of their lives.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In every way this has been an exciting year for ASU 
		Physics. Our skilled and knowledgeable staff have challenged each other 
		to be student focused and to help all of our students succeed.&nbsp; The 
		faculty have established a new strategic plan that emphasizes biological 
		physics, nanoscale science, and particle-astrophysics, and all three 
		groups are building a collaborative environment.&nbsp; The new graduate 
		program has had a successful launch with over twenty new students 
		participating in the &#8216;Research Rotations&#8217; to immerse themselves in 
		research from the very beginning of their graduate student studies.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Colloquium and Distinguished Lecture series have 
		provided opportunities for students and faculty to gather with many of 
		today&#8217;s innovators in science and science policy.&nbsp; Our 
		undergraduate majors have represented themselves and ASU well at many 
		events including the Four Corners Section Meeting of the American 
		Physical Society.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Physics faculty have welcomed two new members, Dr. 
		Cecilia Lunardini and Dr. Robert Ros, and searches are underway for new 
		physics faculty at both the Tempe and Polytechnic campuses. &nbsp;Our physics 
		education programs are focused on high school teachers and they continue 
		to be recognized as setting the standards for defining effective 
		approaches to student learning.<br>
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		We are equally excited about the challenges ahead.&nbsp; In the upcoming 
		year we plan to initiate a new professional master&#8217;s degree in 
		Nanoscience, and we will focus on ways to build collaborations that will 
		enable new research and education programs and provide a multitude of 
		opportunities to our students and faculty. We also plan on building a 
		strong network for the Friends of ASU Physics.&nbsp; To continue the 
		message Ms. Thagard delivered to our recent graduates at convocation, I 
		invite you to let me know how we can contribute to your passion for 
		science, or help find ways to take risks to begin new endeavors or to 
		continue learning and discovering new science.</span></td>

				<i>Andrew Gamalski is

				Mellon and the impact that research holds for the environment.</i><br /><br />
				<b><i>Andrew Gamalski:</i></b><br />
				Between June 3rd and August 11th of this year, I attended a 
				summer REU at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in the Materials 
				Science and Engineering Department (MSE). I studied how ceramic 
				materials such as barium titanate, strontium titanate, and 
				mixtures of the two could use UV radiation to split water 
				molecules to get hydrogen gas. However, measuring the amount of 
				hydrogen gas is difficult to accomplish. Instead we ran the 
				reactions in a silver nitrate solution. The light reactions 
				caused the silver metal to accumulate on the surface of the 
				sample in regions of theoretical hydrogen gas production. We 
				used an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) to take images of these 
				ceramic samples before and after the reactions. In order</td>
				<td style="width:256px;text-align:justify;vertical-align:top;">to interpret the AFM images, I wrote computer 
				program which used the AFM topographical data to compute global 
				silver height and density averages. Overall I found that the 
				mixture of barium and strontium titanate had the most silver 
				deposited on the surface.<br>
				Roughly twenty students participated in this program. 
				Half of the students were from Carnegie Mellon and the others 
				attended different universities. All of the students were very 
				friendly and sociable. We usually relaxed on Saturday nights at 
				a local student&#8217;s home. Since multiple REU&#8217;s were going on 
				simultaneously CMU would host large events such as 
				barbeques and ice cream socials that would bring all the 
				students together. Another activity the REU students would 
				attend was Friday movie night. On a hill right next to campus, 
				the city would host a Friday movie night where different movies 
				would be played on a very large projector screen. It was a lot 
				of fun.<br>
				Attending this REU was an excellent experience for me and I 
				would certainly recommend it to anyone who has an open summer 
				and an </td>
				<td style="width:256px;text-align:justify;vertical-align:top;">interest in scientific 
				research. You simultaneously conduct excellent research, check 
				out a new college campus, and meet new friends.<p><i><b>
				Professor Treacy:</b><br>
				</i>Hydrogen shows much promise as a high energy density fuel, 
				but there are many problems to overcome. The biggest problem is 
				that it takes energy to convert water into hydrogen and oxygen 
				in the first place. In fact, thermodynamics tells us that it 
				will cost more energy than we get back out. Andrew&#8217;s work was 
				applying a clever idea, at the nanoscience level, to construct a 
				catalytic material that uses sunlight to break down water into 
				is constituents. This means that the hydrogen production did not 
				need fossil fuels and generates almost no carbon emission in the 
				process. It is still early days, but ideas like this may end up 
				contributing to alternative low carbon footprint fuels in the 
				future.<br>
