				<font face="Arial" style="font-size: 11pt">
				<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-weight:400">On 
				January 16th, ASU Physics undergraduates - Rebekah Theisen, 
				Sandra Schmidt, and Adlin Abd Jalil - traveled to the University 
				of Southern California (USC) for the 4th Annual Conference for 
				Undergraduate Women in Physics. The two-day conference features 
				professional women in physics presenting their research, talking 
				about the graduate school experience, and examining career 
				options in physics. This year, female undergraduate physics 
				students from all over the Southwest gathered at USC to network 
				and share their experiences as women in physi<img border="0" src="2009-01_files/CUWP.jpg" width="300" height="478" align="right" hspace="1">cs.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The vision for the conference grew in response to the 
				under-representation of women in physics - problem mirrored in 
				many other sciences (see National Science Foundation reports <b>
				<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/showpub.cfm?TopID=2&SubID=45">
				HERE</a></b>). Although women have made statistical gains in the 
				sciences, the rate of progress is still of concern. Professional 
				women in physics and national funding agencies recognized that 
				in order to strengthen the growth rate of females physicists in 
				the United States, women must be brought together to share 
				information, exchange cultural capital, and build a support 
				network not only between scientists, but between scientists and 
				female students considering the field. Additionally, 
				universities must investigate and embrace practices that foster 
				equity in physics department faculty hiring.<br>
&nbsp;Reflecting on the conference, ASU's Schmidt notes, “I’m used to being the 
				only (woman) in my class...it can be isolating. So it was really 
				interesting to meet 75 other people like me who understood that 
				feeling, but who also love physics!” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sister conferences were held simultaneously at Yale University 
				and the University of Illinois. All three universities were 
				linked via satellite during key note addresses. The conference 
				generated a collaborative spirit, palpable and appreciated by 
				both presenters and attendees.&nbsp;Schmidt and Theisen noted how one 
				speaker in particular had originally planned to highlight her 
				recent research, but shifted her talk to focus primarily on her 
				personal experience when it became very clear that conference 
				attendees really wanted and benefited from more personal 
				discussions about individual experiences. &nbsp;Undergraduates easily 
				related to what this female role model had to share. The 
				discussions resulted in a shift in how conference goers 
				perceived <i>themselves</i> 'fitting into' physics. </span>

		<font face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Physicists have always had a special interest in 
		nuclear weapons; an uncomfortable feeling of responsibility and perhaps 
		defensiveness. About ten years ago, I found myself sitting at a small 
		coffee table with Hans Bethe and a graduate student. It was morning 
		coffee at a one-day workshop at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical 
		Physics at UC, Santa Barbara. The workshop was honoring the life of 
		Bethe's friend Rudolph Peierls who had recently died. Among many more 
		important things, Peierls made a crucial contribution to dislocation 
		theory which I was working on at the time. Peierls co-authored the 1940 
		&quot;MAUD&quot; report to the British government on the feasibility of nuclear 
		weapons (with the first reasonably accurate critical mass estimate) on 
		which the Manhattan project was later based. He had also developed the 
		theory of the deuteron with Bethe. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; What to say? Bethe had just given a lucid 
		summary of some of the most important problems he saw in contemporary 
		nuclear physics, about which I knew nothing. He was about 90. I felt 
		about 20. Clearly, the graduate student who joined us at the table was 
		almost as tongue-tied as I was as he offered sugar to one of my greatest 
		heroes in physics, the author of the foundational review article on 
		solid state physics in 1928, and a Nobel laureate for his work on 
		stellar nucleosynthesis. But it happened that I had just read Richard 
		Rhodes's Pulitzer-prize winning book <i>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</i>, 
		which includes a fairly complete biography of Bethe. This gave me an odd 
		feeling of indiscretion - knowing more about his personal life than I 
		should. <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Was the book broadly accurate?&quot; I asked, filled with a precious 
		sense of the opportunity to get history right. <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes,&quot; he said. &quot;Rhodes did an excellent job of telling the Los 
		Alamos story just as I remember it.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to that book and subsequent books on 
		the hydrogen bomb, bioweapons and others, Richard Rhodes has now written 
		a new book on the cold war and its arms reduction treaties. This story 
		of arms control efforts and how the end of the cold war came about are 
		fascinating. It gives a gripping insider's account of how, in 1983, the 
		Soviet Union became convinced that the United States was

		manager. One feels the politburo meetings come to life, as they wrestle 
		with a failing command economy, in which, with full price control, there 
		is &quot;no information on true price.” We witness how the politburo - almost 
		in desperation - gives the leadership to Gorbachev and his perestroika 
		program. Gorbachev certainly emerges as a remarkable individual. As 
		Rhodes ponders &quot;how could the system produce such a person?&quot; A man who 
		&quot;in order to preserve his inner self, developed an impenetrable mask, 
		learning to conceal his disdain for those he despised, and to speak with 
		them in their own language”.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The book moves between key figures on both sides, leading up to 
		Reykjavik. But the account of the in-fighting between Reagan's advisors 
		(in the light of recent events) is also remarkable. Richard Perle, Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz all feature prominently, mostly in defense of the Strategic 
		Defense Initiative (SDI) or Star Wars as it came to be known, and in the 
		manipulation of intelligence to exaggerate the Soviet threat (for 
		internal US purposes) to the extent that we were entirely unable to

		in the classroom so that when they graduate, they have something more 
		than 
		a vanilla degree.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stuart notes this type investment in student success is maximized 
		when community partners and alumni become part of the team.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; With this in mind, ASU Physics' has launched a new development 
		campaign entitled <b><i>Focus Forward</i></b>.<span style="font-weight: 400"> 
		The goal of the campaign is to engage the community and alumni in 
		supporting interactions and experiences that transcend the traditional 
		classroom and deepen the education experience </span></font>

		translators), Reagan began with a wonderful comment, &quot;You and I can 
		achieve anything, provided we don’t care who gets the credit.” In 
		Gorbachev's later opinion, the meetings actually succeeded because they 
		were small, personal and direct - the best way to end the threat of 
		nuclear war. Human rights and Star Wars were difficult, potentially 
		show-stopper, issues. &quot;Trust, but verify,&quot; said Reagan, using the three 
		words of Russian he had learned so many times that Gorbachev covered his 
		ears when he heard it coming. Both had cards with notes. Gorbachev later 
		commented that his own proposals were so radical that Reagan spent 
		minutes looking fruitlessly for a card with the answer to his questions. 
		Reagan had been prepared for a different agenda, unaware that for Gorabchev this was the decisive summit, not a preparatory one.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
		<span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; After days of detailed discussion on 
		throw-weight limits and different classes of weapons, days during which 
		Reagan was constantly trying to convince the skeptical Russians that 
		Star Wars (SDI) was merely &quot;like a gas mask, a purely defensive weapon 
		which makes war less likely&quot;, the climax came on the last day. 
		</span> </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
		<span style="font-size: 11pt">The international press corps waited 
		outside in the freezing Iceland winter for the world leaders to emerge 
		with a statement which would end the threat of nuclear war. Advisors on 
		both sides had worked through the night. </span> </p>

		<span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; The tiny U.S. embassy in Reykjavik meant that 
		the U.S. team wound up in the bathroom. The embassy was so short on 
		copying machines that U.S. copies of the agreement were made on Russian 
		carbon paper. Reagan sat on the toilet, and someone found a plank to put 
		across the bathtub for a seat. Surrounded by Perle, Nitze and George 
		Shultz and with minutes to go, Reagan took a vote on whether to accept 
		Gorbachev's proposal that the SDI be permitted under laboratory research 
		conditions only – a point from which all other prepared agreements on 
		massive arms reductions would follow. Nitze and Shultz voted to accept</span></p>

		<span style="font-size: 11pt">Gorbachev's proposal. Perle voted against it. Reagan sided with Perle. 
		It has never been clear if Perle saw SDI as the political tool it was, 
		or actually believed it could work. So Reykjavik - where both sides had 
		agreed to eliminate all nuclear weapons - failed on the issue of 
		militarization of space and the vote of Richard Perle.</span></p>

		<span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite this, most of the proposed reductions 
		were in fact implemented because of the breakup of the Soviet Union soon 
		after the summit. The<img border="0" src="2009-01_files/book.jpg" width="200" height="290" align="right"> breakup resulted from several factors - the 
		antagonism between the states of the USSR, the emergence of a remarkable 
		leader (Gorbachev), the inevitable failure of a command-style economy, 
		and U.S. expenditures on defense which the Russians were forced to 
		attempt to follow. James Baker said to Gorbachev in 1990, &quot;I have never 
		met a politician with as much bravery and courage as you have, and 
		President George Bush shares this opinion.” </span> </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px">
		<span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; Rhodes ends his book as follows: &quot;Far from 
		victory in the Cold War, the arms race expenditures gave us ramshackle 
		cities, broken bridges, failing schools, entrenched poverty, impeded 
		life expectancy, and a menacing and secretive national security state 
		that held the entire human world hostage.” As Oppenheimer pointed out, 
		once gross overkill has been achieved, additional weapons don't improve 
		security. The U.S. and USSR lived like two scorpions in a bottle - each 
		capable of killing the other, but only at the cost of his own life.<br>
